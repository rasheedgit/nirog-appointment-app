# NirogGyan - Healthcare Appointment Booking App

## Overview

This is a simple and responsive React app I built for booking healthcare appointments.  
It lets users:

- View a list of doctors with their availability
- Search doctors by name or specialization
- See full doctor profiles
- Book an appointment using a form
- Get a confirmation once it’s booked

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- React.js (JavaScript)
- React Router DOM for page navigation
- CSS (no frameworks)
- Mock data in `doctors.json` (no backend)

---

## Improvements with More Time

If I had more time, I would add:

- A backend with Node.js + Express to save appointments
- Store data in local storage or a real database
- Better validation using React Hook Form or Formik
- A proper design system using Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap
- Time slot selection instead of typing manually
- Admin panel for managing doctors
- Error messages and loading states
- Some testing with Jest or React Testing Library

## Challenges Faced and How I Solved Them

Honestly, I didn’t face major challenges because I’ve done similar projects before during my learning with NxtWave. The only small issue I had was with layout and positioning while structuring the webpage. The design part was a bit tricky for me since I’m not very strong in UI/UX, but I’m confident in the functional side — building things and making them work.
